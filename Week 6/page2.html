                <li><h3>Escapism 10/10</h3>
                My personal favorite honestly. You truly are a genuis I mean do you wake up
                in the mornings,<br> look in the mirror and say damn I'm hot, sexy, and ready to 
                kick ass. If you don't then you should <br>becuase you've got it figured out girlfriend!
                <br></li>
                <li><h3>Learn New Things 6/10</h3>
                I can't fault you for that. It's great to learn new things but in all honesty
                if you ever see me <br>reading a non-fiction book please for the love of everything 
                you hold dear put me out of my<br> misery. Good for you though champ</li>
                <li><h3>Relaxation and or Stress Reduction 0/10</h3>
                 GIRL QUIT LYING TO YOURSELF. If you're indeed cool and hate non-fiction first 
                 of all good <br>job, secondly, there is nothing relaxing about fiction. Don't lie 
                 to me or yourself. You ever read <br>Throne of Glass? Fourth Wing? A Court of Thorns 
                 and Roses? The 7 Husbands of Evelyn Hugo? <br>Song of Achillies, rip my heart out 
                 honestly. You are lying if you weren't on the edge of your seat <br>clutching your pearls.
                 So get some therapy and learn how to tell the truth. Or so help me I will <br>find you. </li>
                 <li><h3>Learn Fancy Words 10/10</h3>
                 You're real for that honestly. Me too. Until you read a little too much and don't do 
                 audiobooks.<br> We be out here with some CRAZY pronounciation. Don't worry guys we know 
                 what it means we <br> just yk don't have lives. Oops. Whatever.
                <br></li>
                <li><h3>Other</h3>
                 But Fiona there's no option to say I don't like to read!
                 Um yeah...That would be because you are<br> dead wrong and have no soul.
                 You simply have not read the right books or you're too embarrassed <br>to admit that 
                 you're illiterate. <br><br></li>
