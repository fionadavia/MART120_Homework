The Problem with “Learning Styles” (How do you learn)
Learning styles have always been an interesting concept for me, especially since I’ve had to experiment with different techniques due to having ADHD. I’ve tried various strategies, but I’ve never noticed a huge difference in how I absorb information. That said, I’ve always noticed that one method that does help me is spacing out my study sessions. Seeing it in the article that spacing is actually proven to help with retention was kind of fun and validating.
Learning Style Quiz, my results were pretty spot on for me. I scored 35% tactile and 35% visual, which makes sense when I look at how I learn and organize my life. I’m someone who learns best by doing. Hands-on activities are a big part of how I retain information. But I also rely heavily on visual aids, color coding, writing things down, and even drawing pictures to explain concepts. My phone’s reminders app is practically a lifeline for me. I’ve got notes, lists, and alerts everywhere.
Reading through my results was a bit ironic because it felt like a perfect reflection of how I’ve structured my life. I need to see and touch things to really get a grasp on them. I can’t just hear something and expect it to stick. 
Overall, I do think learning styles play a role in how we absorb information, but it’s not as rigid as some might think. While I know my own style works for me, I also think a mix of techniques can be helpful. I definitely need to be engaged physically, but I also rely on visual reminders and strategies. My takeaway from this was that everyone is different, and finding what works for you, whether that’s through hands-on experiences, visuals, or even spacing tasks out, can make a huge difference in how effectively we learn.
