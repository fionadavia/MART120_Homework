This is my final project proposal: Diver Dash

Proposal:
    For my final project, I want to create a game inspired by Flappy Bird and Pac-Man.
    The player will control a diver who must navigate through underwater obstacles like fish and coral to reach a pearl. A sharks will swim across the screen randomly, the game will end if the diver touches a shark.

Related and Similar Work:
    My game draws inspiration from two well-known games:
    Flappy Bird – simple side-scrolling movement and obstacle avoidance.
        Dong Nguyen – creator of Flappy Bird, whose minimalistic style and addictive gameplay are inspirational.
    Pac-Man – maze navigation while being chased by an enemy.
        Toru Iwatani – creator of Pac-Man, who designed chase-based gameplay that balances fear and strategy.

Anticipated Problems and New Technologies/Techniques
    I will need to learn collision detection (e.g., between diver and coral, diver and shark).
    Creating a scrolling background to simulate underwater movement.
    Developing animated sprites for the diver, sharks, and coral/fish.
